                        Eighteen months ago, I left a cushy stable full-time job to explore everything else life has to offer.  It's been alot of things, and here's some shit I've learned.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned, and often forget, that it's nearly impossible to do it alone, and there's no glory in doing it that way.  Humans are amazing and they're all around you and it's nice to acknowledge them and stand on the shoulders of giants sometimes.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned that there's no one single thing that's gonna make me really happy.  Rather, I want my life to be a delicious potpourri of lots of different little things, and as I get to mix and match what all those thingies are, I get to strike a balance between what gets my time.

                        <br><br>

                        I've been reminded that time passes pretty linearly, regardless of the subjective experience of time that I'm having, so use it while you have it.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned that momentum is amazing.  Sometimes you just need to force yourself to start, and pretty fast you've built habit.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned that morning routines are pretty dope.  I tend to get struck with depression from the moment I wake up in bed nearly every morning, so my morning routine -- get the fck up, shower, meditate for ~20 mins, cook breakfast, write my morning pages ( ~ 750 words / 3 pgs) is an anchor for me hold onto as I weather the morning emotional storm.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned that scheduling can be good, within reason.  Adding a little bit of structure to my day, especially the day or days before, gives me enough structure to craft my day.  An appointment or two mid-day, or even knowing that I had a scheduled social event in the evening, put me at ease enough to allow the unplanned and unscheduled time I need in my days to flow into my day without a feeling of guilt.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned it's hard to create and define your own meaning.  It's often alot easier to let others define it for you.  I left a steady, plush job at the pinnacle of corporate America because I was unfulfilled and felt that the 'meaning' I was assigned at work didn't match my internal values or direction that I wanted to follow in my life.  Without externally defined meaning, I of course needed to define my meaning internally, which is harder than I thought it would be. 

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned that constantly redefining that meaning is fucking exhausting.  What's the optimal time frame to evaluate an experience -- one hour, one day, one week, one month, one year? Who fucking knows, but you get to make it up as you go along.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned to say Yes to opportunities.  Give up 'perfect', and rather embrace the 'good'.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned that I need a balance of activities in my day, generally broken up into: social, intellectual, spiritual, creative, self-care.  Everything in moderation, but don't tip the scales.

                        <br><br>

                        I've learned to prototype experiences -- 'Don't get ready, get started.' As corny as that is (sorry Eric), when you actually start something you are effectively testing a hypothesis against a real experience where you are collecting data, which is much more legit than sitting around thinking about it.  Por ejemplo, purrrhaps I'm thinking about whether I wanna be a performer and do improv.  Instead of sitting around and thinking about it, I signed up for a class and collected real data about my subjective experience of doing improv. After the class, I was able to say, 'ah that's dope'.
