NEXT FEATURES:
- better synth ( fm synth or what?) see tone docs
- export to midi
- support many different scales (copy the scales i have from the other app (code somwehre hopefully))
- BPM slider
- roman numeral notation vs chord notation (vs number notation) clickbox
- different drum beats
- melody generation over it somehow!?
- better song UI, maybe so that there are like slots for each beat of the song and the chords just fill it in. and then its in like 4/4 or whatever
- then i can support non-trad time signatures
