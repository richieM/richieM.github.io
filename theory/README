NEXT FEATURES:
- better synth ( fm synth or what?) see tone docs
- export to midi
- support many different scales (copy the scales i have from the other app (code somwehre hopefully))

better song UI, maybe so that there are like slots for each beat of the song and the chords just fill it in

and then its in like 4/4 or whatever

then i can support non-trad time signatures
